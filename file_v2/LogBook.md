Accomplished: Wrote a module dedicated to downloading the files from google drive and refreshing my memory on how the google drive API worked. Created a thourough outline explaining everything in the google_drive.py module. Exploring an idea to use a file type to take in required variables, such as google drive link, api keys, and directories. This will make it easier for anyone to use this program and help structure code. Briefly looked into creating a user interface, decided to put that on a back burner

Goal for next time: I want to polish up the google_drive.py module before i move on and forget, as well as get a better skeleton for the config files. The next module will be responsible for iterating through the files in a directory, handling each file based on file type, and creating a markdown file. If i am able to accomplish that, next thing is to use mistral ai and open ai to create markdown strings for each file.

Accomplished: Created a config.ini file, should prove useful. still learning how to get full use out of it. polished up the google_drive file, and the read_config file. started work on the next module by trying to use mistral. mistral seems to not be working rn and idk how to fix it. Differnt file types will be sent to individual modules to declutter soe code space and organize it. im hoping this allows any bugs to be centralized in the different area.


Goal for next time: i will try to incorperate the staff through the rain, but not gonna make you do anything you dont want to. get atleast the pdf file to get processed through an ai and creates a markdown string.  other than that i need to add different ways to reead differnt file types, and move foward.
